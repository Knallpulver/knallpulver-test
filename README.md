# Civitas developer test
So you want to be a part of our team? Take this test and see if you have what it takes! 

## Gettings started
In this repository you will find a journey.txt file with data. This file contains everything you need to know to proceed. Fork this repository and submit a link to your repository with code and answer (your code should also print the answer) to us on Discord. 

## The challange
### Part 1
Magish typically eat regular goat kebab, but he needs a lot of magical energy to be able to yell at people all day. For that he needs to rectrive his favorite snack that only grows deep in the jungle. Magish decideds to head out on a expedition into the jungle set by foot together with his amazing team. The jungle is too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air. 

As Magish and the team approaches the jungle, he begin taking a look in their inventory with supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of calories Magish is carrying. 

Magish writes down the number of calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they brought with them, one item per line. Magish separates his own inventory from the teams inventory (if any) by a blank line.

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000
```

In case the Magish get hungry and need extra snacks, he need to know how many calories are being carried by the team member carrying the most calories. In the example above, this is 11000 (carried by the third member).

Find the member carrying the most calories from the journey file in this repository. How many total calories is that member carrying?

### Part 2
By the time you calculate the answer to the last question, Magish realized that the member carrying the most calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.

To avoid this unacceptable situation, Magish would instead like to know the total calories carried by the top three members carrying the most calories. That way, even if one of those members runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.

Find the top three members carrying the most calories. How many calories are those members carrying in total?
